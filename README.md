# What is Dolos?

The goal of Dolos is to bring virtualization to the masses. This is not through better software or automated scripting, but providing hardware specific guides for end users all in one location.

During a typical virtualization migration, there will be many hours of googling and piecing together bits on information from many different sources from completely different hardware and software. The requirement to be familiar enough with terminology, different operating systems and knowing how to diagnos what the problem is creates a relatively high barrier to entry.

Providing a detailed introduction to virtualization and its terminology, a set of best practices and a centralized location of hardware specific issue fixes we hope to reduce this barrier and give users the confidence to try and virtualize their own setup. 

# What Dolos isn't

* Perfect: While we strive to provide a complete user experience, there is no gaurentee that we will have every edge case covered. If you find an issue and find a way to solve it, consider creating a pull request so other don't have to experience the same issues. 
* Optomized: The best practices and methods listed are from tested user experiences, that give "good enough" performance. Performance is as close as possible to bare metal without sacrificing usability or complicating the setup experience extensively. Once you have a working solution up and running, it is recommonded continued reading in perfomance tuning if you wish to extract every bit of performance possible.
* Bleeding Edge: all choices made during the development of this guide favour stability over anything else. What good is an over clocked, benchmark breaking rig if you can't run it longer than 5 minutes without crashing?
